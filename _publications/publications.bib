  abstract = {Abstract Managed multi-context systems (mMCSs) allow for the integration of heterogeneous knowledge sources in a modular and very general way. They were, however, mainly designed for static scenarios and are therefore not well-suited for dynamic environments in which continuous reasoning over such heterogeneous knowledge with constantly arriving streams of data is necessary. In this paper, we introduce reactive multi-context systems (rMCSs), a framework for reactive reasoning in the presence of heterogeneous knowledge sources and data streams. We show that rMCSs are indeed well-suited for this purpose by illustrating how several typical problems arising in the context of stream reasoning can be handled using them, by showing how inconsistencies possibly occurring in the integration of multiple knowledge sources can be handled, and by arguing that the potential non-determinism of rMCSs can be avoided if needed using an alternative, more skeptical well-founded semantics instead with beneficial computational properties. We also investigate the computational complexity of various reasoning problems related to rMCSs. Finally, we discuss related work, and show that rMCSs do not only generalize mMCSs to dynamic settings, but also capture/extend relevant approaches w.r.t. dynamics in knowledge representation and stream reasoning.},

  abstract  = {This article describes abstract dialectical frameworks, or adfs for short.
adfs are generalizations of the widely used Dung argumentation frameworks.
Whereas the latter focus on a single relation among abstract arguments, namely attack, adfs allow arbitrary relationships among arguments to be expressed.
For instance, arguments may support each other, or a group of arguments may jointly attack another one while each single member of the group is not strong enough to do so.
This additional expressiveness is achieved by handling acceptance conditions for each argument explicitly.

The semantics of adfs are inspired by approximation fixpoint theory (AFT), a general algebraic theory for approximation based semantics developed by Denecker, Marek and Truszczyski. We briefly introduce AFT and discuss its role in argumentation.
This puts us in a position to formally introduce adfs and their semantics. In particular, we show how the most important Dung semantics can be generalized to adfs.
Furthermore, we illustrate the use of adfs as semantical tool in various modelling scenarios, demonstrating how typical representations in argumentation can be equipped with precise semantics via translations to adfs.
We also present grappa, a related approach where the semantics of arbitrary labelled argument graphs can be directly defined in an adf-like manner, circumventing the need for explicit translations.
Finally, we address various computational aspects of adfs, like complexity, expressiveness and realizability, and present several implemented systems.},

  abstract =	 {When a processing unit relies on data from external
                  streams, we may face the problem that the stream
                  data needs to be rearranged in a way that allows the
                  unit to perform its task(s). On arrival of new data,
                  we must decide whether there is sufficient
                  information available to start processing or whether
                  to wait for more data. Furthermore, we need to
                  ensure that the data meets the input specification
                  of the processing step. In the case of multiple
                  input streams it is also necessary to coordinate
                  which data from which incoming stream should form
                  the input of the next process instantiation. In this
                  work, we propose a declarative approach as an
                  interface between multiple streams and a processing
                  unit. The idea is to specify via answer-set
                  programming how to arrange incoming data in packages
                  that are suitable as input for subsequent
                  processing. Our approach is intended for use in
                  asynchronous multi-context systems (aMCSs), a
                  recently proposed framework for loose coupling of
                  knowledge representation formalisms that allows for
                  online reasoning in a dynamic environment. Contexts
                  in aMCSs process data streams from external sources
                  and other contexts.}

                  various methods for handling inconsistencies, a
                  problem that occurs with reasoning based on multiple
                  knowledge sources that need to be integrated, with a

                  in order to do some reasoning about the given
                  information. During the last decades many different
                  KR-languages were proposed for a variety of certain

  Abstract =	 {Over the last two decades the interest for Abstract
                  Argumentationsteadily raised in the field of
                  Artificial Intelligence. The concept of Dung's
                  Argumentation Frameworks (AFs), where arguments and
                  their relations are represented in a directed
                  graph-structure, is a well-known, simple, and
                  powerful concept. This framework is used to find
                  acceptable sets of arguments, which have specific
                  properties (e.g. being conflict free), defined by
                  several semantics. Recently Abstract Dialectical
                  Frameworks (ADFs) were introduced, a generalization
                  of Dung's approach, to overcome the limitation of
                  attack-relations being the only type of native
                  relations. To reach this goal, in addition to the
                  relations, total functions are used to decide the
                  acceptance of an argument. These functions are so
                  called acceptance conditions. Due to the high
                  expressiveness of this newly proposed theory, some
                  semantics were only generalized for the restricted
                  bipolar ADFs yet. This work will give an exhaustive
                  overview on ADFs. The restriction to bipolar ADFs
                  for some of the semantics is not desired, so we try
                  to develop a solution to gain the generalized stable
                  model semantics. This semantics is particularly
                  important because the other semantics which are
                  restricted to bipolar ADFs, depend on stable
                  models. To gain such a generalization, we will try
                  to connect the foundations of ADFs to other fields
                  of computer science. So we may relate subclasses of
                  these fields to the bipolar ADF to overcome this
                  obstacle. This connection also makes ADFs more
                  accessible to other fields of computer science. We
                  will concentrate mainly on the introduction of the
                  alternative representation of propositional-formula
                  ADFs (pForm-ADFs), but we will also show that ADFs
                  can be represented as hyper-graphs. Based on the new
                  representation a transformation from ADFs to
                  pForm-ADFs, together with a generalization of the
                  stable model semantics will be presented. In
                  addition some properties between semantics will be
                  investigated and an overview of complexity results,
                  enriched with new ones is given. Currently there is
                  no software system available to compute semantics
                  for ADFs. So in addition to the formal results we
                  also present an Answer Set Programming (ASP) based
                  implementation to solve these highly complex
                  computations. We will also present preliminary
                  empirical experiments.},

abstract="The field of artificial intelligence, especially research on knowledge representation and reasoning, has originated a large variety of formats, languages, and formalisms. Over the decades many different tools emerged to use these underlying concepts. Each one has been designed with some specific application in mind. In the century of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things, a formal way to uniformly exchange information, such as knowledge and belief, is imperative. That alone is not enough, because even more systems get integrated into this online setting and nowadays we are confronted with a huge amount of continuously flowing data. Therefore a solution is needed to both, allowing the integration of information and dynamic reaction to the data. My thesis aims to present a unique and novel pair of formalisms to tackle these two important needs by proposing an abstract and general solution.",

This fails for existential rules, which instead of a single least model have multiple universal models that may not lead to the same results for negative queries. We therefore propose universal core models as a basis for a meaningful (non-monotonic) semantics for queries with negation. Since cores are hard to compute, we identify syntactic conditions (on rules and queries) under which our core-based semantics can equivalently be obtained for other universal models, such as those produced by practical chase algorithms. Finally, we use our findings to propose a semantics for a broad class of existential rules with negation.},

  abstract="Abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs) are a well-studied generalisation of the prominent argumentation frameworks due to Phan Minh Dung. In this paper we propose to use reduced ordered binary decision diagrams (roBDDs) as a suitable representation of the acceptance conditions of arguments within ADFs. We first show that computational complexity of reasoning on ADFs represented by roBDDs is milder than in the general case, with a drop of one level in the polynomial hierarchy. Furthermore, we present a framework to systematically define heuristics for search space exploitation, based on easily retrievable properties of roBDDs and the recently proposed approach of weighted faceted navigation for answer set programming. Finally, we present preliminary experiments of an implementation of our approach showing promise both when compared to state-of-the-art solvers and when developing heuristics for reasoning.",
