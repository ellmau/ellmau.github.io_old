> Dr. rer. nat.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Knowledge-based Systems group of Prof. Dr. [Markus Kr√∂tzsch](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Markus_Kr%C3%B6tzsch) at TU Dresden. My position is funded by [ScaDS.AI](https://scads.ai) (Center for scalable data analytics and artificial intelligence) and the industry-related InnoSale](https://www.innosale.eu/consortium/) (Innovating Sales and Planning of Complex Industrial Products Exploiting Artificial Intelligence) project. I received both, my B.Sc. in "Medicine and Computer Science" in 2009, as well as my diploma in "Computational Intelligence" in 2012, at the Vienna University of Technology. In 2018 I defended my doctoral thesis "Multi-Context Reasoning in Continuous Data-Flow Environments" which has been supervised by Prof. [Gerhard Brewka](http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~brewka/) at Leipzig University.

My research interests are knowledge representation, logic programming, rule-based reasoning, multi-context reasoning, nonmonotonic reasoning, and (abstract) argumentation theory.

I am currently co-organising the Fifth International Workshop on Systems and Algorithms for Formal Argumentation ([SAFA 2024](http://safa2024.argumentationcompetition.org/)). 

My practical and technical interests are currently mainly focused on programming [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and on having a robust production-system, based on [NixOS](https://nixos.org) with flakes. You can find [adf-obdd](https://stefan.ellmauthaler.net/adf-obdd/), my current [NixOS setup](https://github.com/ellmau/nixos), and [my solutions](https://github.com/ellmau/adventofcode) to every part of all 25 `AoC 2021` puzzles of the problems given for [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) at the respective [GitHub](https://github.com)-hosted sites.
